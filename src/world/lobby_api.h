// The API the PlayOnline lobby uses to reach this world: its characters, and entering the world. The lobby never
// touches this world's database; everything it needs from it goes through here.
//
// Every route is under /api/lobby and needs `Authorization: Bearer <network.LOBBY_API_KEY>`. With no key set the
// routes answer 404, so a world that does not serve a lobby exposes nothing. Bodies and answers are JSON. A
// character is named by the content id (chars.accid) it was made on and its charid; the lobby's own content id to
// PlayOnline member mapping never reaches the world.
//
//   POST /api/lobby/characters/list        {"characters":[{"contentId":1,"charId":1}, ...]}
//        200 {"characters":[{"found":true,"contentId":1,"charId":1,"name":"...", ...}, {"found":false}, ...]}
//        One answer per request, in order; not found also covers a character on another content id.
//   POST /api/lobby/characters/check-name  {"name":"Foo"}                          200 {"error":0}
//   POST /api/lobby/characters/create      {"contentId","name","race","face","size","job","nation","startZone"}
//        200 {"charId":3}
//   POST /api/lobby/characters/rename      {"contentId","charId","name"}           200 {}
//   POST /api/lobby/characters/delete      {"contentId","charId"}                  200 {}
//   POST /api/lobby/characters/online      {"charIds":[1,2]}                       200 {"online":false}
//   POST /api/lobby/sessions/enter         {"contentId","charId","key":"<40 hex>","serverAddr","serverPort",
//                                           "clientAddr","clientVersion","clientExpansions","lobbyToken"}  200 {}
//   GET  /api/lobby/session                X-Lobby-Session: <lobbyToken>           200 {"contentId":1,"charId":1}
//
// A refusal is 4xx with {"error":<lobby error code>} for a name (313 unavailable, 314 name server failure) and
// {"error":0,"message":"..."} for anything else; 401 for a wrong key, 5xx when the database fails.
